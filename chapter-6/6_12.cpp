/**
 * 6_12.cpp - (Parking Charges)
 *
 * A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to 
 * three hours. The garage charges an additional $0.50 per hour for 
 * each hour or part thereof in excess of three hours. The maximum 
 * charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00. Assume that no car 
 * parks for longer than 24 hours at a time. Write a program that 
 * calculates and prints the parking charges for each of three 
 * customers who parked their cars in this garage yesterday. You 
 * should enter the hours parked for each customer. Your program 
 * should print the results in a neat tabular format and should 
 * calculate and print the total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts. The program 
 * should use the function calculateCharges to determine the charge 
 * for each customer.
